## [{{page.title}}][1]

For pretty much as long as I can remember I have been interested in startups
and growing a sustainable business. I have finally decided to take the next
step. I'm leaving Rackspace and moving back to Slovenia to start working on
my own startup.

In this post I will provide some background and describe my motivation for doing
that.

### History and Background

Last couple of years were very exciting for me. In 2010 I've joined Y-Combinator
startup [Cloudkick][3]. Later on when Cloudkick was acquired by Rackspace,
I've relocated to Silicon Valley to work for Rackspace in their new [San
Francisco office][6].

During that time I had a chance to work with some of the best people in the
industry, acquired a lot of new knowledge and experienced a lot of things
first-hand.

It's impossible to list all the things I've learned and experienced, but
just to name a few - I've experienced the startup culture, I've experienced the
"Silicon Valley bubble", I've seen our San Francisco office grow from
~30 to ~80 people, I've worked on [Cloud Monitoring][5] (successor to
Cloudkick), I've [launched a product][4] and I've learned how things
work at a relatively large company.

Besides that I've also meet a lot of great people and made a lot of great
friends with which I hope to stay in touch for years to come.

All of that helped me to become not just a better engineer but a better person
overall.

Now you might ask, how does all this relate to running your own startup?

The answer is that I've always paid attention to startups, long before I joined
Cloudkick.

I've been reading articles, books and news about startups for pretty much as
long as I had internet connection (~12 years).

Because of that I always wanted to do my own startup, I've had a countless
number of side projects, websites and ran many different online communities,
but nothing on which I would focus full-time I would personally call a
"real startup".

Experiencing a small and tightly connected team working together to build a
product which makes customer life's easier first hand at Cloudkick, just made
me want to do it even more.

### Why my own startup?

I personally believe that best way to learn something new and retain the
this knowledge is through first-hand experience. This doesn't mean you
should just recklessly dive into something without any background or
theoretical knowledge. Quite the contrary, if a literature is available,
I believe that having a solid theoretical understating of a problem is
one of the pre-requisites to make "learn more through experience"
process really effective.

Same thinking applies to starting my own startup. I've already learned a lot
and experience some of that at Cloudkick, but I didn't join in a really early
phase and I wasn't one of the founders.

This means I wasn't involved as intimately as I would want from the beginning
and I missed a lot of things I still want to learn and experience.

I had plenty of opportunities to join an existing early and not so early stage
startup, but I believe that starting my own thing and being a founder will
allow me to learn more than I otherwise could.

### Why now?

I believe now is the right time for me, because are multiple things which will
probably change over the years which will make it harder for me to do a startup.

Most of the reasons listed bellow aren't anything special and a lot of people
would simple call those things "life".

* I've made a lot of friends and connections which I can ask for help and
  advice
* I'm not settled down or too tied to a particular location yet
* I don't have a family yet
* I'm still relatively young and don't have a lot to lose, but I have plenty to
  gain (learning new things)
* I believe I have a right co-founder. We known each other for a long time,
  we both share the same core values, but we both have different background
  and skills and bring different perspective to the table.
  I think diversity is very important and all of that makes us a great time.
* Most of the things I do well now I will still be able to to well couple of
  years in the future. In fact, I would argue that I will be able to do those
  things better because running my own startup will allow me to learn plenty of
  new things, obtain new experience and allow me to look at the problems from a
  different perspective. I believe that overall those things will also help make
  me a better person and engineer down the road.

I want to add that none of the things listed above are real blockers for
running a (successful) startup. Quite the contrary, I know people who fit in
one of the "categories" described above which are still very successful at
running a startup.

The fact is that those people are in a minority and running a startup by itself
is already a hard thing. Looking at it from a pure engineering and common sense
perspective it makes sense to eliminate other things which could make it even
harder and reduce number of people you could unintentionally hurt (there are
plenty of stories about damaged or broken relationships).

### What are the next steps?

When I get back to Slovenia I will first focus on building a MVP and getting it
out to the users as soon as possible. There will obviously also be a lot of
other non-product development effort related to starting and growing a startup
(legal, incorporating, marketing, ...) but in the end it will all boil down to
to be continuous iteration of the [Build-Measure-Learn][2] process.

I will also try to do a better job with my blog. I will try to write more tech
related articles and how my startup is evolving and what I have learned during
this process.
