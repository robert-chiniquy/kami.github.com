## [{{page.title}}][1]

For pretty much as long as I can remember I have been interested in startups
and growing and running a sustainable business. I have finally decided to
take the next step. I'm leaving Rackspace and moving back to Slovenia to
start working on my own startup.

In this post I will provide some background and describe my motivation for doing
that.

### History and Background

Last couple of years were very exciting for me. In 2010 I've joined Y-Combinator
startup [Cloudkick][3] and later on when Cloudkick was acquired by Rackspace,
I've relocated to Silicon Valley to work for Rackspace in their new San
Francisco office.

During that time I had a chance to work with some of the best people in the
industry, acquired a lot of new knowledge and experienced a lot of things
first-hand.

It's impossible to list all of the things I've learned and experienced, but
just to name a few - I've experienced the startup culture, I've experienced the
"Silicon Valley bubble", I've seen our San Francisco office grow from
~30 to ~80 people, I've worked on [Cloud Monitoring][5] (successor to
Cloudkick), I've [launched a product][4] and I've learned how things
work at a relatively large company.

Besides that I've also meet a lot of great people and made a lot of great
friends with which I hope to stay in touch for years to come.

All of that helped me to become not just a better engineer but a better person
overall.

Now you might ask, how does all this relate to running your own startup?

The answer is that I've always paid attention to startups, long before I joined
Cloudkick.

I've been reading articles, books and news about startups for pretty much as
long as I had internet connection (~12 years).

All of that really made me want to do my own startup. I've had a countless side
projects, websites and ran many different online communities, but nothing I
would personally call a "startup".

Experiencing a small and tightly connected team working together to build a
product which makes customer life's easier first hand at Cloudkick, just made
me want to do it even more.

### Why my own startup?

I personally believe that best way of learning anything new and retaining the
this knowledge is through first-hand experience. This doesn't mean you
should just recklessly dive into something without any theoretical knowledge.
Quite the contrary, if a literature is available, I believe that having a solid
theoretical understating of a problem is one of the pre-requisites to make
"learn more through experience" process even more effective.

Same thinking applies to starting my own startup. I've already learned a lot
and experience some of that at Cloudkick, but I didn't join in a really early
phase and I wasn't one of the founders.

This means I've missed a lot of things I still want to learn and I wasn't
involved as intimately as I would want it to from the beginning.

I had plenty of opportunities to join an existing early and not so early stage
startup, but I believe that starting my own thing and being a founder will
allow me to learn more than I otherwise could.

### Why now?

There are multiple reasons which could change over the years and because of
which I believe now is the right time.

* I've made a lot of friends and connections I can ask for help and advice
* I'm not settled down or too tied to a particular location yet
* I don't have a family yet
* I'm still relatively young and don't have a lot to lose, but I have plenty to
  gain (learning new things)
* Most of the things I do well now I will still be able to to well couple of
  years in the future. In fact, I believe that I will be able to do those things
  better because running my own startup will allow me to learn plenty of new
  things, obtain new experience and allow me to look at the problems from a
  different perspective. I believe that overall those things will also help make
  me a better person and engineer down the road.

I want to add that none of the reasons above are full blockers for running a
(successful) startup. Quite the contrary, I know people who fit in one of the
"categories" above which are still very successful at running a startup.

The fact is that those people are in a minority and running a startup by itself
is already a hard thing. Even from a pure engineering and common sense
perspective it makes sense to eliminate other things which could make it even
harder and reduce number of people you could unintentionally hurt (there are
plenty of stories about damaged or broken relationships).

### What is the first thing I'm going to work on?

TBW

### What are the next steps?

When I get back to Slovenia I first will focus on building a MVP and getting it
out to the users as soon as possible. After that everything is pretty much going
to be continuous iteration of the [Build-Measure-Learn][2] process.

I will also try to do a better job with my blog. I will try to write more tech
related articles and how my startup is evolving and what I have learned during
this process.
