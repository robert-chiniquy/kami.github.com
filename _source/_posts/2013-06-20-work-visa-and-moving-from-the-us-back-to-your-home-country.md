## [{{page.title}}][1]

In my [recent post][12] I wrote that I'm leaving my current job and moving back
to Slovenia to start working on my own startup. In this post I'm going to
provide a high level overview of a process and most of the bureaucratic things
which are involved if you have a some kind of work visa (H1B in my case) and
you want to move back to your home country.

### Motivation

If you search around the web you can find plenty of blog posts, articles
and resources for people who got a job or want to work in the US (
e.g. ["Getting a job in San Francisco"][2]).

<div class="imginline"><a

class="inline"></a><span class="image-caption">Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, California</span></div>

The same is not true if you turn the situation around. If you currently hold
some kind of work visa and you want to move back to the home country there
are basically no high level resources you could use to know what to expect.

I recently went through this process myself so I have fresh and first hand
experience. Actual process involved a lot digging and reading through long
and mostly boring legal documents.
I hope this post will act as a high level overview, help other people in a
similar situation and give a better idea of how the whole thing looks like
to people who never went through a process like this personally.

A lot of things described in this post are similar to the process you need to
go through if you are just changing your job or moving to a different location,
but there are two major differences:

1. If you have H1B, there is no grace period which means you are on a tight
schedule and need to make sure all the dates align perfectly.
2. You are mostly on your own. If you get a job offer from a respectful company
in the US, the company will usually pay the lawyers and take care most of the
bureaucracy. The whole process is still very stressful and there are a lot of
factors you nor lawyers can control, but at least you are not on your own.

### Disclaimer

First I want to add that I'm going to talk about my specific case and people
who hold H1B visa and the same things might not apply to other type of visas
valid for work.

**Second of all, I'm not a lawyer nor a tax advisor so please, if you are not sure
about something, do your own research and consult your lawyer and / or
tax advisor before doing something based just on this blog post.**

### Why move outside of the US in the first place?

First of all, a lot of people will ask why move outside of the US in the
first place? Why not just start the company in the US? Isn't Silicon Valley
one of the best places for a technical and social startup to be?

To start with the last questions - the answer is yes. For majority of the
technical and social startups Silicon Valley indeed is the best place to be.

Sadly if you are foreign-born and don't have a US citizenship you are mostly
out of luck. The reason is that US immigration doesn't welcome foreign-born
entrepreneurs without US citizenship and makes it basically impossible to
start your own company in the US if you don't have a lot of money to try
your bets with the investor visa (E2) or similar.

class="inline"></a><span class="image-caption">Visualization of different type of visas and path to the green card.</span></div>

That is very sad, especially because a lot of large and successful US companies
were started by foreign-born entrepreneurs. The whole immigration problem is a
very complex topic and I can't do it justice in a single paragraph. All I can
say is that I'm happy to see other countries recognizing this problem and trying
to do something about it (examples include [StartupChile][3] sponsored by the
Chilean government and [Canada's Start-Up Visa program][4]).

Luckily recently a bunch of well known Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have stepped
together and started working on a new immigration reform. The whole reform is not
ideal, but it's a step in the right direction and a big improvement over the current
situation. I hope the bill will pass in the senate, but I'm not too optimistic
because similar efforts have failed in the past.

### H1B and grace period

Contrary to a popular belief there is no grace period for H1B holders. You lose
your H1B (and your status) as soon as you leave your job.

If you want to do everything correctly and / or come back in the future
it should be in your best interest to leave the country as soon as possible
after your last work day.

In my case I left the country one day after my last working day.

### Resignation Letter

In California you are employed at will which in the layman's terms means that
either you or your employer can terminate the employment relationship at any
time, with or without reason (exceptions include discriminatory and a couple of
other reasons).

Common practice when quitting your job is to give around 2 week notice to your
employer. In a special case like this you need to figure a lot of things out
(401k, apartment, ESPP, selling your belongings, etc.) which aren't under your
control and involve talking to HR and other people and institutions.

This means you should take all of this into account before giving your notice
and make sure you have plenty of time to figure all of this out.

### Sailing permit, taxes and the IRS

If you are on a work visa and you are going to leave a country for a longer
period you need to obtain a document called "[sailing permit][14]" from the IRS.

If you read about it online, people says that almost no one checks for a sailing
permit when you leave the country. If you ever want to return to the US and do
everything the right way you should obtain this document.

To purpose of this document is to prove IRS that you don't ow them any money and
if you do, you need to pay it before you can get a permit and legally leave the
country.

The way this process works is as follows. You go to the local IRS office and
with you, you need to have the following documents (for a full list see the
[IRS website][10]):

* Photo ID (passport / california id / driving license)
* Your visa (usually located in your passport)
* Plane ticket which shows your date of departure
* Tax return for the previous year (to show that you paid any taxes due)
* W2's for the previous years
* Pay stubs for the current year (to show taxes were withheld from your
  paychecks)
* Filled [1040C][13] form

<div class="imginline"><a

class="fancybox" title="Regular 1040 tax return form. You will need to fill this

class="inline"></a><span class="image-caption">Regular 1040 tax return form. You
will need to fill this at the end of the current tax year.</span></div>

The last part is one of the most important ones. [1040C][13] is a one time early tax
return for a foreign alien leaving the country. You basically prove that you
don't owe any taxes. If you do you need to pay them before you leave. If the IRS
owes you money they won't return this when you leave, but you need to claim
that when you are filling your regular tax return for the current tax year.

If you only have a single source of income (your job), aren't self employed and
don't have any vested shares, filling 1040C is pretty straightforward.

Keep in mind that things will get more complex when you are going to file your
regular tax return for the current tax year (1040 or 1040NR). If you meet the [
substantial presence test][11], you will also ow US taxes for any money you make
outside the US in this tax year. Most of the details again depend on your
specific situation so be sure to do your own research.

If there is no treaty between the US and your home country you will also need
pay taxes to the US and your home country. Luckily that is not the case with
Slovenia, because we have [signed a treaty for avoidance of double taxation][8].

### Selling your belongings

This title is pretty self explanatory and it's almost the same if you are just
moving to a different location.

The only difference is that under this scenario you are usually under time
pressure and all of the dates must line up perfectly.

class="inline"></a><span class="image-caption">Garage sale is one way to get rid of your belongings.

In my case, I luckily didn't own a car or too many items so this process wasn't
too painful.

### Moving out of your apartment

This is only applicable if you are renting as I did.

Specific details depend on your lease agreement, but usually you need to give
at least 30-day notice in writing to your landlord.

### 401k

If you are enrolled into a 401k plan you have multiple options. Depending on
your provider you can leave money in the account (if you ever plan to come
back). Other options include transferring money to a similar fund in your home
country or taking the money out when your employment has been terminated.

Keep in mind that under normal circumstances you can't start a process of
early withdrawal until you no longer work for a company that provides your
401k.

If you take the money out of the account early (before reaching the retirement
age) you will also need to pay regular income tax and 10% early withdrawal
penalty.

What is best for you depends on your specific situation, you home country and
how much money you have in your account.

### Bank Accounts

If you are not a citizen most bank require you to have either social security
number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to have an
account open with them.

If you have H1B work visa you mosty likely also have a social security number,
because H1B alone it's not enough to work in the US. You usually appyly for
social security number as soon as you arrive in the US on H1B. Once you get
your number it's yours for life.

This means that usually you can keep your bank account open, unless your bank
also requires you to have a valid US address. Some banks require that while
others allow foreign account holders. It's best to check with your bank.

### Health Insurance

Usually when you leave a job your company insurance is not valid anymore.
Specifics depend on the company. In some cases insurance is still valid until
the end of the month and in case of layovers company might even pay insurance
for a couple of more months after the termination.

Health care can be a big and expensive pain if you are temporarily without a
job in the US (e.g. [COBRA][9]).

Luckily this wasn't a problem for me because we have a universal healthcare in
Slovenia and I returned back immediately after I left my job.

### Conclusion

This blog post is pretty specific to my situation, but nevertheless I hope it will
help clear things up, save time and act as general overview for other people
in a similar situation.
