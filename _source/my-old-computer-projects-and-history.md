## [{{page.title}}][1]

This page describes my early computer history and the project I have worked on
back then.

I have primary decided to create this page because I want to look back at it in
10 years from and remember and laugh about all the fun and stupid things I have
did or worked on when I didn't really know what I was doing :-)

Personal projects here cover a lot of different areas. From many website I
have built and online communities I helped to run to working on Soldier of
Fortune Platinum and Counter Strike maps and mods where I learned a lot
about computer graphics and game development.

Keep in mind that most of the projects listed here are now long dead or not
relevant anymore, but I still learned a lot of things while working on them.

This was a quick brain dump so the content here might seem a big
unstructured and in a weird order. Sadly the quality of most of the screenshots
is also really bad, but this was all I could find.

### 1999 - First computer

In 1999 I have received my first personal computer. It was an Intel Pentium
with 8 MB of ram running at 133Mhz.

During my early years I spent a lot of time on the computer, but I didn't do
any programming at that time. I spent most of my time tinkering with Windows
(at that time this was Windows 95). This usually meant deleting stuff in
`System/` directory which required me to reinstall Windows and that is how
I learned a lot about Windows.

### 2002 - First Internet connection

In 2002 I have received my first internet connection. I was lucky enough (or
unlucky, depends how you look at it) that I never had to deal with dial up or
DSL. My first internet connection was a cable connection capped at 128Kbs/64Kbs.

### 2002, 2003 - IRC, Eggdrop and my first programming / scripting language

Not long after receiving my first internet connection I have discovered a thing
called "IRC" and IRCNet IRC network. This was probably one of the best things
which have happened to me, because I have obtained most of my early knowledge
by spending a lot of time on IRC and tinkering with anything related to it.

During those days there was no such thing as NickServer or ChanServ which
meant there was a lot of abuse. Abuse from mild things such as channel
take-overs to large scale DDoS attacks.

IRC also got me interested programming and around that time I learned my first
programming / scripting language. This language was called mIRC scripting
language. At that time mIRC was the most popular IRC client for Windows and
it was a base platform for a lot of mIRC scripts.

Soon after I also discovered a think called Eggdrop - an IRC bot written in
C which allowed you to write simple plugins / extensions in TCL scripting
language. After discovering Eggdrop I became fascinated with TCL. One of the
reasons was that back then only other programming / scripting / markup language
I knew was mIRC scripting language and HTML.

Some projects I have worked on during that time:

* Read a book about HTML and launched my first personal website. At that time my
  personal website only contains a bunch of Dragon Ball and Pokemon images :P
* Launched a website for my first bigger personal project - a so called
  "Slovenian Eggdrop website". The website contained a partially translated
  documentation from egghelp.org and a support forum.
  This website had many iterations. First version was a static website hosted
  on a free hosting provider and one of the later versions was running on a
  custom PHP CMS I wrote back then.
* Developed multiple popular TCL scripts for Eggdrop.
* Set up multiple IRC servers and networks. Most of the servers were running
  unrealIRCd server daemon.
* Got my hands on multiple DDoS bot executables, disassembled them and obtained
  details about multiple command and control servers. Whenever possible I
  forwarded those details to corresponding abuse@ email addresses. At that time
  most of the DDoS bot software was really primitive and had no way to spread
  itself by exploiting known security holes in operating systems. This meant
  that the bad guys needed to manually distribute this software. Usually this
  meant manually linking to those executable on popular websites, and tricking
  not-so savy users on the IRC into clicking those links.
* Inspired by AversE and Evangeline (IRC bots developed by a great developer
  from Poland which were faster than Eggdrop and better at protecting your
  channels from take overs) I started working on my own bot called
  "EvolutionX". Similar to AversE and Evangeline the core was based on Eggdrop
  and written in C and most of the business logic lived in modules written in
  TCL. I have made quite a lot of progress on the bot, but I never managed to
  fully finish it and release it publicly. Primary reason for this was that at
  that time I didn't really have a lot of experience with C or understand it
  that well so this was slowing me down significantly.

### 2004 - Playing with my first desktop Linux distribution (RedHat)

Linux was a pretty common platform for hosting IRC servers and bots at that
time, but I never really used it besides SSHing to a couple of servers, so I
decided to install my first Linux distribution (RedHat) on my desktop. The
whole Linux experience was really fun and I loved it so a year or so later
when I got my second PC I decided to install Slackware on it and uses it as
my personal "server".

Having a personal server was great, because I have spent a lot of time
tinkering with it and I learned how to set up all of the basic services (Apache,
MySQL, pureftpd, proftpd, icecast, ... ) and how they work.

### 2003, 2004, 2004 - Online Gaming era (Soldier of Fortune 1, Counter Strike, etc.)

Not long after I received my first internet connection one of the friends
borrowed me a game called Soldier of Fortune platinum. After launching the
game for the first time I some how managed to get myself in multilayer mode.
Soon after I realized how much fun it was to play with other people online
I became kinda addicted to the game and spent next two years playing it
many hours every week.

After looking back at this this era 10 years, I kinda miss it because no other
game later on gave me the same amount of fun or satisfaction as SoF 1 did. In
fact, in the last 5 years or so I played almost no computer or Xbox games.

Some projects I have worked on during that time:

* Developed multiple scripts & mods for Soldier of Fortune Platinum.
* Developed multiple maps for Soldier of Fortune Platinum.
* Developed multiple clan websites for my clans usually powered by
  either phpNuke, vwar.de or a custom CMS written by me.
* Helped with organizing and maintaining the website for multiple Soldier of
  Fortune 1 competitions and leagues.
* Set up multiple TeamSpeak servers and Counter Strike servers running on
  Linux.
* Launched an online graphical community (cooldown.vze.com) with a couple
  of online friends where people could request free so called "sigs" (forum
  signature images). Community received a lot of traction early on, but sadly
  because some of some issues with the hosting provider and no backups site
  died a couple of months in.
  I still feel bad about this site, because it had a lot of potential. If
  the site wouldn't die I believe that it could even be bigger and better
  than DeviantArt is these days.

### 2005, 2006 - Slovenian Ubuntu and FreeBSD communities

* I was one of the founding members and people who have launched first
  Slovenian Ubuntu Community (ubuntu.si) website. I helped with setting up the
  website and forum and later on I wrote a custom CMS which integrated with the
  forum and powered the website.
* Launched first Slovenian FreeBSD community (freebsd.si). I developed a custom
  CMS for the website written in PHP and wrote most of the articles on the
  website.
* Developed multiple popular TBDev.net mods ("free leech" mod, request for free
  leech mod, etc.) TBDev was at that time the most popular open-source PHP
  application for running your own torrent tracker. It was also the software
  which powered most of the big torrent websites back than.
* Developed a dynamic website for my class (1-br.com, 2-br.com) using Xoops
  CMS project as a core. The website included a lot of custom scripts written
  by me, such as a script which would notify you over MSN a couple of days
  before the example or when someone uploaded a file to the website

### 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010

* Developed a Slovenian website and started an online community for the Need
  For Speed PC game franchise (nfs-slo.net).
* Developed a web control panel written in PHP and Bash for managing FreeBSD 
  servers
* Developed a Slovenian version of "nutrition data" website (zivila.net).
* Operated and ran multiple Soldat servers and stats websites
* Ran Slovenian Stargate Wiki website and project

  Source, Crysis).
* Developed an open-source blog engine written in PHP called OpenBlog
* Developed a website (isdnscacheflushed.net) which people could use the query
  multiple DNS servers at the same time and compare the results in real time.
  The website itself was written in Python and powered by Django and the
  backend services which performed DNS resolutions were using Twisted Python.
* Founded and developed a website for a Slovenian Erepublik community
  (erepublik.si). This site also went through many iterations and besides
  the CMS which is powering the website I also developed a bunch of mods for
  the phpBB forum software).
* Developed a simple Android 1.5 application for displaying weather forecast.
* Tried to get back into SoF 1 so I developed a website for my new SoF 1 clan
  and SoF 1 community.
* Reverse engineered a protocol for Stargate Resistance PC game and developed a
  website which tracked and displayed players statistics such as number of
  kills, etc.
