Rackspace?

- For anyone not knowing who Rackspace is
- HQ in Texas, I work for SF office
- Started with managed and dedicated hosting
- Our moto is fanatical support
- If someone asks me what is the biggest difference if you compare it to Amazon
  I would say fanatical support and service.
- In the past couple of years we have also been drinking the cloud kool-aid
- In 2010 Rackspace founded OpenStack with Nasa (swift + nova)
- OpenStack is an open Apache 2.0 licensed platform for building your own cloud

Why I selected this topic?

- There are many other interesting topics I could talk about, but there are two
  reasons why I have selected this one:

  - Not many companies around here are aware of advantages of this approach or
    are using it.
  - If I look back and think which thing had the biggest impact on the industry in the last
    couple of years I think "Continous Deployment" is one of those things and
    the other one probably is "DevOps".

- I also think more general topics like this are more useful, have bigger
  impact and more widely applicable than topics about some specific tool
  or framework (e.g. how to efficiently store time series data in Cassandra).

Who is using it?

- Pretty much all of the "new-area" companies do it
- If you Google around you can find a lot of good posts from most of the
  companies mentioned on the slide (Etsy, Netflix, Github, Twitter)
- Etsy is interesting because they kinda pioneered click to deploy with
  deployinators
- Keep in mind that there are a lot of variantions and different level of
  automation

Continuous Deployment in Practice

- Yay, now lets get our hands dirty
- I will show two real life examples of continous deployment in action
- I worked on both producs
- I think they are interesting because they have different requirements and one
  of them runs on bare metal and other one runs on cloud.
- As usual, there is also a disclamer at the bottom. Just because we do
  something this way this doesn't neccessray mean you need to do it exactly the
  same for your products because you might have different needs and / or
  requirements. You can start simple, automate small things, etc.

In Closing:

- You can use iterative approach and start smal. You don't need to go
  from 0 automated stuff to everything automation. Do it in small steps automate
  one thing then another and eventually most of the things will be automated.
  Hm this iterative thing sounds familar, almost like agile :P Oh damn, I said I
  need to slap myself every time I say agile.

It's not that I don't like agile, I think it's great it's just that every time
you give some approach / whatever a name people start creating cults and stuff
around it and sell it like it's the best thing on earth and only possible
option.

In general I prefer to avoid any kind od extremism in cases like this and say do
what works best for you and use a right tool for the job.

Rackspace Service Registry - Deployment process

- API server is temporary disabled in the load balancer (it's drained) which
  caused load to shift to other active API servers
- Compared to Cloud Monitoring this is a bit easier, because Cloud Load Balancer
  has a better API than Apache mod_proxy
- Max capacity is calculated for 4 API servers, but we actually have 5 API servers
  because during deploy 1 is temporary taken offline and this reduces the capacity.

Possible Questions

Why doesn't CM use cloud?

- Special needs
- Gear deployed in multiple regions when cloud wasn't available yet
- CBS wasn't available when we started
- SSL is expensive, need beefy machines or special SSL terminators
- We could go hybrid in the future
