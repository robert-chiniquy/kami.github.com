What is Luvit?

- It's a framework for building network applications built on top of Lua,
  livUV and LuaJIT
  - Lua - language as you know it
  - libuv - event loop and networking layer used by Node.js
  - LuaJIT - JIT compiler for Lua
- Supports TCP, UDP and HTTP
- It's fast
 - Supposedly
 - There are some benchmarks on the net' which shows it's faster than Node.js,
   but not sure if this is still accurate
 - We don't care that much about speed, mostly about low memory footprint

Luvit - HTTP Server Example

- Not much to see here
- Pretty similar to Node.js
- Just a quick example to get you excited

Luvit History

- Originally developed by Tim Caswell
 - Wanted to test uv + luajit with lua
 - He has a new pet project now (his own language)
- Young project
  - Same problem as other young projects:
    - unstable
    - not a single well known way of doing something
    - no package manager
    - setting build infrastructure (buildbots, etc.)
    - not a lot of tooling
    - not a lot of docs / tutorials
    - ...
    - it's a trade off!

Why should I care?

- Lua is cool
 - Originally developed by a some academic dudes from a Brazilian university iirc
 - Mostly (co-rutines, etc.)
 - Some of the same problems as JavaScript (e.g. Number type)
 - Other issues - 1 based indexing
 - Used as a scripting language of choice in many games and other software (WoW,
   etc.)
- It could be a great tool for some set of problems

- LuaJIT is cool
  - JIT - just in time compiler - traces the code, compiles hot code paths to
    the machine code
 - At the moment it's the worlds fastest tracing JIT (take that v8!)

Why we picked Luvit?

- Previous experience with Lua from the Cloudkick agent
 - C-core for bootstraping, main business logic in lua
 - didn't use luvit
 - didn't use JIT
- Main business logic in Lua makes it easier to implement auto updates
  which don't require full process to be restarted
- We don't envision C core to be updated a lot (exception: security issues,
  etc.)
- Lua is easy to embedd
  - Easy C API
 - Simple stack (push & pop) based API
- Cross-platform supprt
 - well libuv was a decent start
 - Thanks Brandon, Ryan, Paul, etc.!

Virgo

- Platform for building hosts agents (le big goal)
- Initial implementation = Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Agent
- Collects metrics and system information and sends it to the endpoint
- A lot of ideas and space for other features (remote command execution, etc.)
- Our goals
  - Low memory footprint
   - Statically linking stuff makes it harder
   - IIRC still some low hanging fruit (OpenSSL flags, etc.)
 - Secure
 - Cross-platform / portable

Thanks

- Thanks
- Hope I got you excited and if you have a similar problem you will consider
  using Luvit (and / or Virgo)
- As mentioned previously, project is OSS so contributions of any kind are
  always welcome
- P.S.: Shameless plug for my employer - if this kind of problems interest you
  go to rackertalent.com/sanfrancisco or email me
