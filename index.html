<p>Yesterday we hosted <a href='https://lcdesignday.eventbrite.com'>Libcloud Design Day and Meetup</a> at the <a href='http://rackertalent.com/sanfrancisco/'>Rackspace San Francisco office</a>.</p>

<p>This blog post includes a short recap of main topics we covered. It&#8217;s assembled mostly from my <a href='https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-dev/201306.mbox/%3CCAJMHEmLtN9Fskqj5GTc8_Kfro08xjADvtYBSeT7i%3D-iesg%3Durg%40mail.gmail.com%3E'>Libcloud mailing list post</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of the event was to sit down with the <a href='https://libcloud.apache.org/'>Libcloud</a> users and developers, indicate current biggest pain points and weaknesses and brainstorm about possible solutions.</p>

<p>Event was relatively small, but we had a good sample set of Libcloud developers and user.</p>
<div class='imginline'><a class='fancybox' href='/images/2013-06-12-libcloud-design-day-recap-improving-libcloud-and-plans-for-the-future/lc_design_day.jpg' title='Photo taken at the event'><img class='inline' src='/images/2013-06-12-libcloud-design-day-recap-improving-libcloud-and-plans-for-the-future/lc_design_day_thumb.jpg' /></a><span class='image-caption'>Photo taken at the event</span></div>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of people who have attended the event:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://journal.paul.querna.org/'>Paul Querna</a> (of Apache fame, also Libcloud committer)</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/jedsmith/'>Jed Smith</a> (Libcloud committer)</li>

<li><a href='http://alexgaynor.net/'>Alex Gaynor</a> (PyPy, Django, Topaz, etc. contributor)</li>

<li><a href='http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/'>Glyph Lefkowitz</a> (<a href='https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/'>Twisted</a> creator)</li>

<li><a href='http://dreid.org/'>David Reid</a> (Twisted contributor)</li>

<li>Chris from <a href='https://mist.io/'>mist.io</a> (mist.io uses Libcloud with many different providers)</li>

<li>Rick from Google working on the <a href='https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine'>Google Compute Engine</a> driver</li>
</ul>

<p>You might recognize some of the names above - we were very happy to have some very well known and knowledgeable people from the Python world to join us.</p>

<h3 id='pricing_data_distribution'>Pricing data distribution</h3>

<p>Currently we bundle JSON file with provider pricing data with every release. There is no documented and easy way for user to update this file or for us to ship an updated version without releasing a new version of Libcloud.</p>

<p>We should provide easy way to update this file which includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command line tool for updating the file - user can specify a custom URL to the file. By default it should point to the latest version from the version control (<a href='https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/libcloud/trunk/libcloud/data/pricing.json?view=co'>https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/libcloud/trunk/libcloud/data/pricing.json?view=co</a>)</li>

<li>Modify the code so it also tries to find the default pricing data file in <code>/home/user/.libcloud_data/pricing.json</code> (or whatever) directory</li>

<li>Document this process and add it to the documentation page</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Most of code for this functionality already exists (<a href='https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/pricing.py'>https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/pricing.py</a>). We just need to add a code for downloading a file from a remote server and the cli tool.</em></p>

<h3 id='exception_reporting_for_partial_failures_in_the_methods_which_result_in_multiple_api_calls__http_requests'>Exception reporting for partial failures in the methods which result in multiple API calls / HTTP requests</h3>

<p>Currently we have no standard interface for exceptions which get raised during a partial failure in a method which has side affects. Partial failure means that a function which performs multiple API calls failed half way through and this potentially resulted in some (but not all) resources getting created.</p>

<p>We should provide a special exception for cases like this. This exception should contain information about resources which got created. Users can then use this information to perform &#8220;rollback&#8221; / cleanup partially created resources.</p>

<h3 id='support_for_async_api_in_the_core'>Support for async API in the core</h3>

<p>Currently we only expose sync / blocking API. This mostly works OK for simple command line scripts, but it&#8217;s less than ideal for long running process or applications which performs a lot of API calls which could be made more efficient and faster if we supported an async api.</p>

<p>As part of this change we would eventually need to refactor every driver which would also provide other side benefits such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code which is more maintainable and easier to test (smaller functions)</li>

<li>Easier way to handle partial failures / exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>We didn&#8217;t come to a consensus on everything, but we agreed on a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change should be backward compatible, we should default to the sync API and existing behavior code / shouldn&#8217;t change</li>

<li>New async API should be available separately (e.g. under <code>libcloud.async.*</code> or whatever it ends up being)</li>

<li>We should refactor internal code to follow new interfaces defined in the PEP 3156 (<a href='http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/'>http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/</a>)</li>

<li>We should start with a small scale experiment and try this in a single method in a compute driver</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='documentation'>Documentation</h3>

<p>We are weak on the documentation side.</p>

<p>Going forward we should strictly enforce that every patch which adds new code / functionality contains documentation and appropriate docstrings.</p>

<h3 id='migrating_to_git'>Migrating to git</h3>

<p>We want to make contributing as easy as possible. SVN doesn&#8217;t help with that and increases barrier to entry.</p>

<p>Action item here is me opening an Apache Infrastructure ticket for switching to git.</p>

<h3 id='dropping_support_for_python_25'>Dropping support for Python 2.5</h3>

<p>Supporting Python 2.5 adds code complexity which we would like to avoid. Main problem is that a bunch of CLI tools based on Libcloud usually also run on older versions of Linux distributions (e.g. RHEL 5) which still ship with Python 2.5.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t managed to actually talk about this one, but we should explore an option of removing support for Python 2.5 in the future release.</p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall the event was fun and productive. We had a lot of good debates and hopefully a lot of the things we talked about will result in real code and improvements in the near future :-)</p>

<p>Thanks again to everyone who joined us. If you missed the event or you couldn&#8217;t attend, don&#8217;t worry!

    <h2 id='time_for_new_challenges'><a href='/2013/06/09/time-for-new-challenges.html'>Time for new challenges</a></h2>

<p>For as long as I can remember I have been interested in startups and growing a sustainable business. I have finally decided to take the next step. I&#8217;m leaving Rackspace and moving back to Slovenia to start working on my own startup.</p>

<p>In this post I will provide some background and describe my motivation for doing that.</p>

<h3 id='history_and_background'>History and Background</h3>

<p>The last couple of years were very exciting for me. In 2010 I joined the Y-Combinator startup <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudkick'>Cloudkick</a>. Later, when Cloudkick was acquired by Rackspace, I relocated to San Francisco to work for Rackspace in their new <a href='http://rackertalent.com/sanfrancisco/'>San Francisco office</a>.</p>

<p>During that time I had a chance to work with some of the best people in the industry, acquired a lot of new knowledge and experienced a lot of things first-hand.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to list all the things I&#8217;ve learned and experienced, but just to name a few - I&#8217;ve experienced the startup culture, I&#8217;ve experienced the &#8220;Silicon Valley bubble&#8221;, I helped grow our San Francisco office from ~30 to ~80 people, I worked on <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/monitoring/'>Cloud Monitoring</a> (successor to Cloudkick), I <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/blog/keep-track-of-your-services-and-applications-with-the-new-rackspace-service-registry/'>launched a product</a> and I learned how things work at a relatively large company.</p>
<div class='imginline'><a class='fancybox' href='/images/2013-06-09-time-for-new-challenges/ck_team_2010_1.jpg' title='Cloudkick team in 2010 (missing Russel Haering)'><img class='inline' src='/images/2013-06-09-time-for-new-challenges/ck_team_2010_1_thumb.jpg' /></a><span class='image-caption'>Cloudkick team in 2010
(missing Russel Haering)</span></div>
<p>Besides all of that, I also met a lot of great people and made a lot of great friends with whom I hope to stay in touch for years to come.</p>

<p>All of that helped me to become not just a better engineer but a better person overall.</p>

<p>Now you might ask, how does all this relate to running your own startup?</p>

<p>The answer is that I&#8217;ve always paid attention to startups, long before I joined Cloudkick.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reading articles, books and news about startups for as long as I had internet connection (~12 years).</p>

<p>Because of that I always wanted to do my own startup. I&#8217;ve had a countless number of side projects, websites and ran many different online communities, but nothing on which I would focus full-time I would personally call a &#8220;real startup&#8221;.</p>

<p>At Cloudkick, I experienced first hand what it was like working with a small and tightly connected team, building a product which makes life easier for customers. The experience just made me want to do it even more.</p>

<h3 id='why_my_own_startup'>Why my own startup?</h3>

<p>I personally believe that best way to learn something new and retain the this knowledge is through first-hand experience. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should just recklessly dive into something without any background or theoretical knowledge. Quite the contrary, if a literature is available, I believe that having a solid theoretical understating of a problem is one of the pre-requisites to make &#8220;learn more through experience&#8221; process really effective.</p>

<p>The same thinking applies to starting my own startup. I&#8217;ve already learned a lot and experience some of that at Cloudkick, but I didn&#8217;t join in a really early phase and I wasn&#8217;t one of the founders.</p>

<p>This means I wasn&#8217;t involved as intimately as I would want from the beginning and I missed a lot of things I still want to learn and experience.</p>

<p>I had plenty of opportunities to join an existing early and not so early stage startup, but I believe that starting my own thing and being a founder will allow me to learn more than I otherwise could.</p>

<h3 id='why_now'>Why now?</h3>

<p>I believe now is the right time for me, because there are multiple things which will probably change over the years and make it harder for me to do a startup.</p>

<p>Most of the reasons listed bellow aren&#8217;t anything special and a lot of people would simple call those things &#8220;life&#8221;.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve made a lot of friends and connections which I can ask for help and advice</li>

<li>I&#8217;m not settled down or too tied to a particular location yet</li>

<li>I don&#8217;t have a family yet</li>

<li>I&#8217;m still relatively young and don&#8217;t have a lot to lose, but I have plenty to gain (learn new things)</li>

<li>I believe I have the right co-founder. We&#8217;ve known each other for a long time, we both share the same core values, but we both have different background and skills and bring different perspective to the table. I think diversity is very important and all of that makes us a great team.</li>

<li>Most of the things I do well now I will still be able to to well couple of years in the future. In fact, I would argue that I will be able to do those things better because running my own startup will allow me to learn plenty of new things, obtain new experience and allow me to look at the problems from a different perspective. I believe that overall those things will also help make me a better person and engineer down the road.</li>
</ul>
<div class='imginline'><img class='inline' src='/images/2013-06-09-time-for-new-challenges/zen_of_python.png' /><span class='image-caption'><a href='http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/'>The Zen of Python</a>, emphasising "Now is better than never"</span></div>
<p>I want to add that none of the things listed above are real blockers for running a (successful) startup. Quite the contrary, I know people who fit in few of the &#8220;categories&#8221; described above who are still very successful at running a startup.</p>

<p>The fact is that those people are in a minority and running a startup by itself is already a hard thing. Looking at it from a pure engineering and common sense perspective it makes sense to eliminate other things which could make it even harder and reduce number of people you could unintentionally hurt (there are plenty of stories about damaged or broken relationships).</p>

<h3 id='what_are_the_next_steps'>What are the next steps?</h3>

<p>When I get back to Slovenia I will first focus on building an MVP and getting it out to users as soon as possible. There will obviously also be a lot of other non-product development effort related to starting and growing a startup (legal, incorporating, marketing, &#8230;) but in the end it will all boil down to to be continuous iteration of the <a href='http://lean.st/principles/build-measure-learn'>Build-Measure-Learn</a> process.</p>

Book</span></div>
<p>I will also try to do a better job with my blog. I will try to write more tech related articles and how my startup is evolving and what I have learned during this process.</p>

    <h2 id='hosting_apt_repository_on_rackspace_cloudfiles'><a href='/2012/07/22/hosting-apt-repository-on-rackspace-cloud-files.html'>Hosting APT repository on Rackspace CloudFiles</a></h2>

<p>In this post I will describe how to host APT repository on <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/'>Rackspace Cloud Files</a>.</p>

<p>First you need to create a CDN enabled container. You can do this using Libcloud or the new <a href='https://mycloud.rackspace.com'>Rackspace control panel</a>. Depending on how frequently you are going update your APT repository it is also recommended to lower the container TTL from the default value of 3 days to 900 seconds.</p>

<p>After you have created a CDN enabled container you need to install Python script I wrote which allows you to sychronize files from a local directory to a container hosted in one of the Storage providers <a href='http://libcloud.apache.org/supported_providers.html'>supported by Libcloud</a>.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>  sudo pip install file-syncer</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next we are going to create a dummy APT repository::</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>mkdir -p /tmp/apt-test/conf</span>
<span class='go'>cat &gt; /tmp/apt-test/conf/distributions &lt;&lt;DELIM</span>
<span class='go'>codename: precise</span>
<span class='go'>Components: main</span>
<span class='go'>Architectures: i386 amd64</span>
<span class='go'>DELIM</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Add a test package using <code>reprepro</code>:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/main/a/acpi/acpi_0.09-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb</span>
<span class='go'>reprepro -b /tmp/apt-test/ includedeb precise acpi_0.09-3ubuntu1_amd64.deb</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And test the script:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>file-syncer --log-level=DEBUG --directory=/tmp/apt-test/ --username=your username --key=your api key --container-name=container name</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If everything went well, you should see an output similar to this one:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>22 Jul 2012 22:36:05 : INFO     : Using provider: CloudFiles (US)</span>

<p>After the upload has finished, you can test the repository by adding it to your APT sources list:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>  echo &quot;deb http://c15173579.r79.cf2.rackcdn.com precise main&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/test-api-repo.list</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We are also going to disable APT HTTP request pipeling. This step is required, because a nginx proxy running in front of the CDN doesn&#8217;t seem to support HTTP/1.1 pipelining. If you skip this test apt-get update will still work, but it will get stuck on <code>[Waiting for headers]</code> for a longer period of time.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>  echo &quot;Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth &quot;0&quot;;&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/pipeline-workaround.conf</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can test that everything is working by issuing the following command:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>  sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-cache policy acpi</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should get an output similar to this one:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='console'><span class='go'>acpi:</span>
<span class='go'>  Installed: (none)</span>
<span class='go'>  Candidate: 1.6-1</span>
<span class='go'>  Version table:</span>
<span class='go'>     1.6-1 0</span>
<span class='go'>        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages</span>
<span class='go'>     0.09-3ubuntu1 0</span>
<span class='go'>        500 http://c15173579.r79.cf2.rackcdn.com/ precise/main amd64 Packages</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That is it. To make sure your container is always up to date, you need synchronize it every time you add a new packages. This can be achieved in multiple ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>adding a script which runs synchronize command after adding a package</li>

<li>adding a cron job which periodically runs the sync command</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome to Libcloud April 2012 update post. Sorry for skipping a couple of months, but I have been pretty busy again. In any case, here is a short but sweet April update.</p>

<h3 id='what_has_been_accomplished_in_the_past_few_months'>What has been accomplished in the past few months</h3>

<li><a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-dev/201202.mbox/%3CCAJMHEmJJcigBO%2BZoSyxFGvc5Z37t-t3KKHBHyyMi7L-J4-Y03A%40mail.gmail.com%3E'>Libcloud 0.8.1</a> with support for compressed responses (gzip, deflate) has been released.</li>

<li><a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-dev/201204.mbox/%3CCAJMHEmJzeGL%2BU1PNeX0T-1dcxUC1um88jQTAmskZ-mXTQ3QLGw%40mail.gmail.com%3E'>Libcloud 0.9.1</a> with improvements in deploy functionality and OpenStack driver has been released.</li>

<li>I have attended <a href='https://us.pycon.org/2012/'>PyCon US 2012</a> in Santa Clara in March. As always, it was a lot of fun talking with old and meeting new friends. This year we didn&#8217;t hold a Libcloud development sprint, but I still managed to talk with some Libcloud users and prompted Libcloud at the AWS open space session.</li>

<li>Libcloud has applied to <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012'>Google Summer of Code 2012</a> under Apache organization. We have received 1 slot. Student Ilgiz Islamgulov will be working on the <a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-159'>Libcloud REST interface</a> this summer.</li>

<ul>
<li>We are currently moving towards 1.0 release which means mostly polishing the code, fixing bugs and avoiding big and API breaking changes. A lot of code, especially compute API has already been battle tested, but there are still some parts which I want to see improved (deployment functionality for example) before releasing 1.0.</li>

<p>Past few months have been pretty busy here and you may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t post a monthly update post in the last two months. This doesn&#8217;t mean nothing has been going on though! In fact, quite the contrary. Last few months have been very busy and we have shipped two new releases and a voting thread for a new 0.7.1 release was just started a few days ago. More about that bellow.</p>

<li><a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201111.mbox/%3CCAJMHEm+8XX704mSY4qw4P0YSBjGK=0SWCKjzSHBe8sLD__2UnA@mail.gmail.com%3E'>Libcloud 0.6.1</a> with a brand new DNS API (among many other improvements and additions) has been released.</li>

<li>A few days after releasing 0.6.1 we have also released <a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-users/201111.mbox/%3CCAJMHEmJTN407_JJRfnwDuJxNsWCupEGc0cXWxs=M-n8HoHoQKQ@mail.gmail.com%3E'>0.6.2</a> which was primary a bug-fix release, but it also includes some new features and improvements such as support for OpenStack Auth 2.0 API, support for new Amazon location (Oregon) and a CloudStack driver.</li>

<li>A few weeks ago a new committer, Hutson Betts (hbetts) has <a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-dev/201111.mbox/%3CCAJMHEm+08-1MMCgHDZgULc+StDiwgR+_krVZvHOJF0odcU_OWg@mail.gmail.com%3E'>joined our team</a>. He has previously mostly contributed to the OpenNebula driver and we believe giving him commit access will allow him to contribute more directly and easily and is a good thing for the whole project.</li>

<ul>
<li>A lot of things!</li>

<li>This weekend I have just finished adding support for Python 3 to Libcloud. Now we have a single code base which supports both, Python 2 and 3 and as far as I know we are the first Python cloud library which does that. I hope other projects will follow. If you are interested in more details you can read my post titled <a href='/2011/12/03/lessons-learned-while-porting-libcloud-to-python-3.html'>Lessons learned while porting Libcloud to Python 3</a> where I have described some of the issues which I have encountered while porting the library. Armin has recently also wrote a good blog post about Python 3 which you should read - <a href='http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/7/thoughts-on-python3/'>Thoughts on Python 3</a>.</li>

<li>I am moving to San Francisco where I will work full time for Rackspace. I will try to organize a Bay Area Libcloud meet-up in the upcoming weeks (hey, free pizza and beer!). I will post more info on the website and mailing list when all the details are fleshed out.</li>
